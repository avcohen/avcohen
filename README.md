# Hello.

I'm a full-stack developer specializing in projects with a focus on modern, performant technologies, accessibility and ux.

These days, I'm mostly likely building something with JavaScript, React, JAM Stack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup), GraphQL, AWS Serverless and Shopify.

I'm currently working freelance and open to new projects. [Drop me a line](mailto:avcohen@gmail.com)!
