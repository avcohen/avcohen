# Hello.

Iâ€™m a creative developer with experience building UX-focused websites and SPAs with modern Javascript frameworks.

These days I'm enjoying working with Gatsby, Next.js, 11ty, React, GraphQL, Contentful, Sanity.io, AWS Serverless and Shopify.

I'm currently open to new opportunities for collaboration. [Drop me a line](mailto:avcohen@gmail.com)!
